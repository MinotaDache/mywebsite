# Master Thesis: Cohesion of fleet of drones using Bio-inspired Visual Learning Algorithm!

Desert ants, thriving in harsh environments, use incredible navigational strategies like path integration and visual route tracking to forage effectively. Their brilliance inspired the development of a cutting-edge approach to navigation in swarm robotics. 

A robust biologically constrained neural model inspired by desert ants assesses the familiarity index of a panorama. Using a visual compass algorithm, the system determines orientation based on previously learned panoramas. This enables a swarm of drones to visually learn and maintain formation along a path using low-resolution images. 

I implemented this model in a simulation environment, deploying a fleet of quadcopter drones using Gazebo, ROS2, Python, and OpenCV. The primary goal was to enable the swarm to learn a given formation and maintain it despite disturbances, ensuring robust and reliable operation in dynamic conditions. 

This project showcases how blending biological principles with advanced robotics can create systems capable of navigating complex environments with resilience and adaptability. üåçü§ñ
